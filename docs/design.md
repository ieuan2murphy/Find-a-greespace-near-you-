# Design

Due to the very 'nature' of our application, we have opted for a more green/nature themed aesthetic which really focuses you on the key aspect of what we are trying to achieve and that is for greenspaces to be a known and loved space for all. 

With our initial design, we wanted our users to have a sense of seeing what they could be experiencing while providing them a sleek, yet simple, way to navigate our application.
