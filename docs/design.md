# Design

Due to the very 'nature' of our application, we have opted for a more green/nature themed aesthetic which really focuses you on the key aspect of what we are trying to achieve and that is for greenspaces to be a known and loved space for all. 

With our initial design, we wanted our users to have a sense of seeing what they could be experiencing while providing them a sleek, yet simple, way to navigate our application.

This home page allows for quick and easy access with minimal effort, giving users a very comforting and user friendly environment to work with. As you will come to notice, we are all about making things tailor made towards our users while providing them with a relaxing space to find their relaxing space.

Similar to the home page, our users get a similar look and feel in terms of style and quality while navigating all aspects of our application. Our main goal is to empower our users to take a step out into the greenspaces around them and see how truely beautiful the world is around them!
