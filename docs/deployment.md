# Deployment

## Initial phase
During this phase, getting the users location, local api data and the system to work with synchronicity was key. This allowed the user to freely access the application and see what greenspaces were around them and how to get to them with ease while providing a streamlined and stress free user interface. The users had to enable a popup that prompted them to either enable their location via the webpage or change the location tracking via their operating software settings as this is key towards finding the spaces nearest to the users. The apis used during this stage were Bristol Open Data API and Google maps Service API. Both of these services are critical towards the applications operation. 

## Futher Release 
After ensuring all aspects of the application ran smoothly, we began rolling out a login and home page section of the application which allowed users to have that personalised experience. In addition to this new release, clicking on a greenspace allows the user to now see comments made on that particular space made by other users in the local area or by staff members.

With this new addition, users will now be able to interact with fellow greenspace lovers like never before! This also allows the user to see how other people think about spaces and find the perfect greenspace for them. Furthermore, we have also implemented a suggestion tab inside of the profile aspect of the application. This will allow the user to submit any ideas or useful feedback to us so we can continue to improve the lives of people one greenspace at a time.
