# Project development plan

## Business case: Finding your nearest greenspace.

### Problem statement
With the Greenspaces project, we aim to create a space to find spaces. Using local data and our own expert input from both experienced greenspace goers and the local community, we have both accurate and friendly knowledge about your nearest greenspaces!

### Benefits
When it comes to the benefits, the most notible benefit which would only effect the user is their quality of life will drastically be increased. Being out in a greenspace has been proven to improve not only your physical state but your mental state too. In addition to this, people walking around to greenspaces reduces the need for transport and thus overall reducing carbon emmisions as a whole.

### Options Considered
While there is competition in terms of the greenspaces area, we aim to provide a tailor made and personalised experience for our users. This will set us apart from other potential competitors in the space and therefore be a better overall achievement for the project.

### Risks 
As stated in the previous text, due to competition it would be hard initially to overtake any competition within the space. However, since we aim to provide a unique and personalised experience to all of our users, we believe this shouldn't be a prevelant issue. Another big risk for us is data management/security. Since we will be providing a personalised experience, users will need to log in to our application to receive such treatment putting us and their data at risk for data breaches. 

### Context and evaluation
People today are more inclined to stay indoors due to a variety of reasons. Some of which may include but are not limited to: 

•	Working remotely 
•	Having the day off
•	Feeling the need to stay inside
•	Video gaming

Going outside and being in a relaxing green space presents you with a copious amount of benefits, many of which, the people of today lack due to the sky rocket in technology.
